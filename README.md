For this project, I have set-up a Github repository and accesseed the repository on my machine. I did this with my basic terminal commands. 

First, I navigated to my "repos" directory on my local machine using cd respos. 

Next, I moved the repositroy onto my machine using the git clone "ssh" command line tool. 

Finally, I reflected on this excersie in this "README.md"
